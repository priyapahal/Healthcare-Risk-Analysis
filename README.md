# Healthcare Risk Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes structured healthcare data to identify key risk factors influencing medical expenses. Using Python and SQL, the dataset is cleaned, explored, and transformed into actionable insights.

The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end data analytics workflow including preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and KPI extraction.
